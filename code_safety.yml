    comments: Potentially disclosive defaults. Index and Show have no authorization
      mechanisms in place. Under default NdrError configuration (as at rev fe0a25b)
      any (potentially malevolent) user can view captured errors and possibly harvest
      information. JMP 2016-01-12 - Authorisation configuration is now required.
